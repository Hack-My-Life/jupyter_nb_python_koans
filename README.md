Python Koans Redux in Jupyter Notebook Format

The inspiration for this repo came from Jess Hamrick's excellent [post](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2014/04/09/python-koans-with-ipython-notebook/) and [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/jhamrick/10344303/) outlining a proof of concept for re-creating Greg Malcom's [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) in Jupyter Notebook format!
